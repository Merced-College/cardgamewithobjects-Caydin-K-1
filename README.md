//Features Added:
- Replaced the original array-based card storage with an **ArrayList**, making the deck dynamically resizable and easier to sort and manipulate.
- Implemented **Collections.sort()** using the `Comparable<Card>` interface in the `Card` class.
- Added a **compareTo()** method to support sorting.
- Wrote detailed **comments** explaining each part of the code.

//Files:
- `Main.java` - Runs the program logic.
- `Card.java` - Card class with fields, accessors, mutators, toString, and compareTo.

//Summary:
For this project, I created a Java program that builds a full deck of playing cards using a custom `Card` class. The class includes constructors, getters, setters, a `toString` method, and a `compareTo` method to allow sorting. I also improved the program by switching from a basic array to an `ArrayList`, which makes the deck more flexible and easier to manage. I added functionality to sort the deck by card rank using `Collections.sort()`, and included clear comments throughout the code to explain how everything works.
